# BreastCancerClassifier

## About
The project focuses on developing supervised learning models for cancer classification using various data preprocessing, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning, followed by performance evaluation on a test dataset.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the ML models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for experimenting and running the code.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for model training, validation, and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for visualizing data and model performance.
